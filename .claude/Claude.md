# Claude.md — ShoulderTap

## Project Overview

ShoulderTap is a Slack app that intelligently triages workspace messages and delivers them at the right time based on urgency and the user's calendar context. Instead of constant Slack notifications, users get:

- **Immediate DMs** for truly critical messages (urgency 5)
- **Batched notifications** during natural calendar breaks for important messages (urgency 3–4)
- **Daily digests** for low-priority FYI messages (urgency 1–2)

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js with NestJS framework
- **Slack Integration:** Bolt.js (wired into NestJS)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with MikroORM
- **LLM:** Claude API (for urgency scoring)
- **Calendar:** Google Calendar API (OAuth2)
- **Deployment:** Railway or Render

## Architecture

```
Slack Events API → Bolt.js listener → Pre-filter pipeline → LLM scoring → Notification router
                                                                              ├─ Immediate DM (urgency 5)
                                                                              ├─ Break queue (urgency 3–4, flushed on calendar gaps)
                                                                              └─ Daily digest (urgency 1–2)
```

## Build Phases

The project follows a 7-phase build sequence defined in `build-sequence.md`. Always check that file for the current phase and milestones. In summary:

1. **Skeleton & Slack OAuth** — NestJS + Bolt.js, Slack app manifest, OAuth, event logging
2. **Database & Pre-filtering** — Postgres/MikroORM, activity tracking, heuristic filters
3. **LLM Scoring** — Claude-powered urgency scoring (1–5 scale), immediate DM for critical
4. **Google Calendar Integration** — Calendar OAuth, break detection, queued delivery
5. **Batching & Digest** — Batch logic for 3–4, daily digest for 1–2, DM formatting
6. **User Preferences & Feedback** — Slash commands / App Home, VIP senders, feedback loop
7. **Onboarding & Polish** — Guided setup, error handling, monitoring

## Key Conventions

### Project Structure (NestJS)

```
src/
  app.module.ts
  main.ts
  slack/              # Bolt.js integration, event listeners, commands
  auth/               # Slack OAuth + Google OAuth flows
  messages/           # Message ingestion, pre-filtering, storage
  scoring/            # LLM urgency scoring prompt + logic
  calendar/           # Google Calendar sync, break detection
  notifications/      # DM delivery, batching, digest jobs
  users/              # User entity, preferences, activity tracking
  common/             # Shared utilities, decorators, guards
```

### Database / MikroORM

- Entities live in their respective module folders (e.g., `src/messages/message.entity.ts`)
- Use MikroORM migrations — never modify the schema by hand
- Entity naming: singular PascalCase (`User`, `Message`, `CalendarEvent`)
- Always use transactions for multi-entity writes

### Slack / Bolt.js

- Bolt app instance is created in the `SlackModule` and injected via NestJS DI
- All event listeners and command handlers live in `src/slack/`
- User tokens (not bot tokens) are stored per-installation for reading messages
- Bot token is used for sending DMs
- Respect Slack rate limits — use queuing for bulk DM sends

### LLM Scoring

- The urgency scoring prompt lives in `src/scoring/` — treat it as a first-class artifact; changes should be deliberate
- Urgency scale: 1 (FYI) → 5 (critical, needs response now)
- Always store the raw score AND the LLM's reasoning with each scored message
- Pre-filter before calling the LLM — only ~30% of messages should reach scoring
- Use structured output (JSON) from the Claude API for reliable parsing

### Pre-filter Heuristics (Phase 2)

Messages should be skipped (not scored) if:

- The user is currently active in that channel (sent a message recently)
- The message is in a muted channel (user preference)
- The message is a bot/integration post (unless from a VIP integration)
- The message has no mention, thread reply, or keyword relevance to the user
- The message is a reaction-only event

### Notification Delivery Rules

| Urgency | Delivery     | Timing                         |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 5       | Immediate DM | As soon as scored              |
| 3–4     | Batched DM   | Flushed at next calendar break |
| 1–2     | Daily digest | End of working hours           |

### Hexagonal Architecture & DDD

Every module follows this layered structure:

```
src/<module>/
  domain/
    <entity>.ts              # Domain entity/aggregate with business logic methods
    <port>.repository.ts     # Repository port interface (abstract class or interface)
    <port>.gateway.ts        # External API gateway port interface (if needed)
  application/
    commands/                # Command handlers (write operations)
    queries/                 # Query handlers (read operations)
  infrastructure/
    persistence/
      <entity>.mapper.ts     # Maps persistence model ↔ domain model
      <entity>.repository.ts # Implements repository port using Prisma/ORM
    gateways/                # Implements gateway ports (Slack, Google, Claude APIs)
  <module>.module.ts         # NestJS module wiring — binds ports to adapters via DI
```

**Rules:**
- Business logic belongs in domain entities/aggregates — NOT in services or handlers
- Aggregates are fetched and saved as a whole unit via repositories
- Domain entities are plain TS classes — never ORM/Prisma models
- Repositories use mappers to convert between persistence and domain models
- Mappers expose `toDomain()` and `toPersistence()` — pure functions, no side effects
- All external I/O (DB, Slack API, Google Calendar API, Claude API) is behind a port interface
- Port interfaces are defined in the domain layer; implementations live in infrastructure
- Use NestJS DI to bind port interfaces to their infrastructure implementations
- Application handlers orchestrate domain objects — they do not contain business logic
- DTOs are for API input/output; domain models are for business logic; persistence models are for the DB

### Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode
- Use NestJS decorators and DI idiomatically — no manual instantiation
- Prefer `async/await` over raw promises
- Keep modules small and focused; one domain concept per module
- Controllers/listeners handle I/O boundaries only — delegate to command/query handlers
- Use DTOs for API inputs; domain entities for business logic; persistence models for storage

### Testing

- Unit tests for scoring logic, pre-filters, and batch/digest rules
- Integration tests for OAuth flows and message pipeline
- Use a test Slack workspace — never test against production workspaces

### Error Handling

- Wrap all Slack event handlers in try/catch — a thrown error kills the event ack
- Retry failed LLM calls with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- Log all errors with context (user ID, channel ID, message timestamp)
- Use Sentry (Phase 7) for production error tracking

## Important Notes

- **User tokens vs Bot tokens:** ShoulderTap needs user token OAuth (not just bot) to read message content the user would see. Bot token is used for sending DMs.
- **Privacy:** Messages are processed for scoring but should not be stored longer than necessary. Respect workspace data policies.
- **Rate limits:** Both Slack and Claude APIs have rate limits. Always queue and throttle outbound requests.
- **Calendar sensitivity:** Never expose calendar event details in Slack DMs — only use calendar data internally for timing decisions.
